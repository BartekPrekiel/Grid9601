        <p>Fort Yellowstone was established as a U.S. Army cavalry post in 1891 at Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. The army administered the park from then until 1918 when it was transferred to the newly created National Park Service. The first structures (1891–1897) were mainly wood-framed buildings in what has been called the "cottage style", some with Colonial Revival elements. Later structures (1908–1913), including the current park headquarters and the Horace Albright Visitor Center, were primarily built from locally quarried sandstone, and many of these are still in use as administrative offices, residences for National Park Service employees, and museums. The army left a legacy of policies and practices that served as precedents for the National Park Service's management of national parks, including wildlife management, protection of natural features, and prosecution of illegal activities.</p>
